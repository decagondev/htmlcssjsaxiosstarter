# Frontend Readme

## Phase 1 - HTML Structure
We have already created a structure for the `index.html` and `contact.html` files. Your tasks in this phase are to read over the html markup and follow the [Frontend Readme: Phase 1](/frontend/README.md)

**Phase 1 is complete when you have completed the tasks in the [Frontend Readme: Phase 1](/frontend/README.md).**

## Phase 2 - CSS and Styles
Have you got this far? Well done! You are getting into the fun stuff: *styles*. Your task now is to read over the `index.css` and `contact.css` files and complete the tasks in the file's comments.

**Phase 2 is complete when you have filled in the styles requested in the `css files comments`.**

## Phase 3 - JavaScript Ahoy!
In this phase you have been tasked with updating the `index.js` and `contact.js` files. Read the comments in each file to find out what you need to do. Only concern yourself with comments marked with `Phase 3`. **Ignore the `Phase 4` comments at this point.**

**Phase 3 is complete when you have followed the `Phase 3` comments in the `js` files, and your front end is pulling data from the `staticContacts` array**

## Phase 4 - Let's GET some `CR` in our Axios
OK, so now that you are a JavaScript aficionado, it is time to flex your JS muscles and use a module. The Axios module, to be precise. You are now tasked with moving away from the confines of our `staticContacts` array, and will be refactoring the `index.js` and `contact.js` code to allow us to perform `POST` and `GET` operations by way of the `Axios` module. For this phase, you must follow the respective comments marked `Phase 4` in the JS files.

**Phase 4 is complete when you have refactored the front end to pull data from the back end api using Axios**

## Phase 5 - Learn & Be Curious (Stretch Goals)
For this phase feel free to style the front end however you see fit, and maybe stretch your JS skills by researching how to get this App to be a fully CRUD front end.
To get the front end up to speed, you will want to read up on Axios [HERE](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro), and also look at html docs and references [HERE](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp). With those resources and some clever googling, you should be able to have a fully CRUD App! *Remember: For a real super-flex, feel free to change the type of App and make your own data etc;*

**Phase 5 is complete when you feel like you have a CRUD App with some styles of your own choosing**
